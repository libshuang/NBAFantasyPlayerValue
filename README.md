### Problem Statement and Key Objective

<b> Context </b>
- There's countless ends of fantasy sport articles and projections that provides the same values as mines.
My projections is to be as risk adverse to the random events (e.g. injuries, COVID protocols, mid-season rotational changes, trades) as possible by using prior historical boxscores and numbers of games played,  as well as last year's team record.
