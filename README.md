### Problem Statement and Key Objective

<b> Context </b>
- Yelp data is publicly available, descriptive of businesses by area and location and is regularly updated. Specifically, Yelp generates ($, $$, $$$, $$$$) to indicate relative business costs. Can this data be used to estimate neighborhood affluence? Is it a good predictor?

<b> Problem Statement </b>
- Traditional methods estimate geospatial wealth via income or unemployment rates

- However these data sources are not always updated frequently enough or may not provide sufficient granular data for the agile needs of disaster response agencies

<b> Key Objective </b>
- Build a model that will take zip codes or location as input and will leverage frequently updated commercial data to estimate geospatial affluence with high accuracy
